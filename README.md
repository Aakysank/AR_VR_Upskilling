# AR_VR_Upskilling
I am upskilling myself in AR VR. This is my journey. I am uploading my self assignments while doing the upskilling for AR VR.

Blender
Did Apple bowl modelling, texturing, and rendering myself.

1. Modelled the apple, applied the texture from the textures folder (using stencil approach in texture painting mode)
2. Modelled the bowl, applied porcelain material from blenderkit addon.
3. Modelled the wooden floor, using array modifier and removed the sharp edges using bevel modifier , applied wood material from blenderkit addon.
4. Modelled the deformed cloth fabric using animation, and applied the cloth texture and normal map from the reference textures.
5. Modelled the knife and knife handle using the reference image available and applied texture from the image.(using stencil approach)
6. Rendered using EEVEE.
